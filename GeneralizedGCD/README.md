***Generalized GCD***

The greatest common divisor (GCD), also called highest common factor (HCF) of N numbers is the largest positive integer that divides all numbers without giving a remainder. 

Write an algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers. 

***Input***
The input to the function/method consists of two arguments - 
num, an integer representing the number of positive integers (N). 
arr, a list of positive integers. 

***Output***
Return an integer representing the GCD of the given positive integers.

***Example***
Input:
num = 5
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Output:
2
